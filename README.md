This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Instructions

First you should to this [this link](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) to download the api server. The instructions to sep up the server are in the link (In short, `cd api-server`, `npm install` and `node start`). Then you can download this project and simply `npm install` and `npm start` to start the app.

## Attribution

The styles used in this app were heavily influnced by `material-ui` ([Link](https://material-ui-next.com)), and some styles were adapted from examples provided in their website.

Additionally, the reducer and the api middleware designs were adapted from the exampled provided by the Redux documentation ([Link](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Examples.html)).

## Future

CI and coverage have been set up and can be actually worked on if time permits. Also, the error handling seems a bit complicated so the implementation of error related components has been temporarily given up.
