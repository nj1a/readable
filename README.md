This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Instructions

You can simply `npm install` and `npm start` to start the app.

## Attribution

The styles used in this app were heavily influnced by `material-ui` ([Link](https://material-ui-next.com)), and some styles were adapted from examples provided in their website.

With the help of this module, efforts were devoted to achieve responsive UIs. Under priliminary manuel testing, the app
should work from mobile devices with small screens up to 4K monitors.

Additionally, the reducer and the api middleware designs were adapted from the exampled provided by the Redux documentation ([Link](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Examples.html)).

The app was developed by implementing the functionalities first (with no css or js for styling) and styles were introduced later on. Some features are, however, almost impossilbe to implement without styling, e.g., a progress bar.

## Future

CI and coverage have been set up and can be actually worked on if time permits. Also, the error handling seems a bit complicated so the implementation of error related components has been temporarily given up.
